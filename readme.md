IMQS Ubuntu Docker Base Image & Sub Images
===========================================

The base image is built once a week, to make sure that our base Ubuntu image has the latest security patches installed.

If you're building an image based on Ubuntu, then use this as your base (The docker image is called `imqs/ubuntu-base`).
